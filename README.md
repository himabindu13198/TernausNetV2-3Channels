# TernausNetV2-3Channels
Kerala Floods Damage Assessment using TernausNetV2 (Remote Sensing Imageries and Deep Learning) 

# Problem Definition:

Post Disaster damage quantification is one of the most challenging tasks for an administration. Current practices involve volunteer-driven ground surveys, windshield surveys, etc which are time-taking, prone to erroneous judgements, observations and conclusions. In recent years, analysis of remote sensing imagery has become imperative in the domain of environmental monitoring and specifically for detecting, mitigating and managing a natural disaster. Remote sensing data analysis for damage assessment is a more automated, less time taking and more accurate approach.

Our project focuses on the problem of post disaster infrastructure damage assessment using change detection methods given satellite imagery datasets from before and after the floods.

# Proposed Solution

Areas impacted by the disaster can be identified and analyzed using time-series data of satellite imagery. We propose the usage of an Encoder-Decoder architecture, The TernausNet V2 built on U-Net model for building detection on our acquired dataset.

Using this model, we intend to infer the footprints of buildings that stood intact before and after the striking of the 2018 floods in the state, and then infer the damage.
